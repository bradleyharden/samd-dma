//! DMA library for Microchip SAM micro-controllers.
//! 
//! This library provides a convenience wrapper around the DMA and CRC subsystem of the SAM family of micro-controllers.
//! It is designed to be maximally expressive while providing a convenient interface for simple tasks.
//! 
//! # Safety
//! 
//! The primary goal of this library is to abstract away directly writing to registers. It is not concerned with larger 
//! goals like totally memory safe DMA, which is left to the discretion of the library user and the goals you are 
//! trying to accomplish. If you only need one descriptor per channel and aren't reading from the write-back address, 
//! you can use this library without any unsafe sections. More advanced features of the DMA system are not protected by 
//! this library, and it is possible to shot yourself in the foot if not careful. I highly recommend reading the 
//! relevant sections of the manual for your family of micro-controller to understand how the DMA system works and
//! operates on memory outside of the compilers knowledge.
//! 
//! # SAMD21
//! 
//! Because of the design of the DMA system on the SAMD21 family, any channel methods that modify channel registers are
//! NOT interrupt-safe. Beware of accessing or mutating channel register without calling in an interrupt-free section.
